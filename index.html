  <h1>Quisn — Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 4, 2025</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to Quisn mobile apps and related services (“Quisn”, “we”, “our”, “us”). If you have questions, contact us at <a href="mailto:michael@quisn.com">michael@quisn.com</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="overview">1) Overview</h2>
  <p>We collect and use information to provide core functionality like accounts, messaging, notifications, and content sharing (e.g., posts and photos). We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal data.</p>

  <h2 id="camera">2) Camera Permission Disclosure (Android)</h2>
  <p><strong>Why we request <code>android.permission.CAMERA</code>:</strong> Quisn uses the camera only when you choose to capture photos or videos—for example, to update a profile picture; attach images/videos to posts or chat; or showcase meals, menus, or services.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Capture happens on demand (never in the background).</li>
    <li>You can cancel before uploading.</li>
    <li>If you upload, the media is sent to our servers to deliver the feature you requested (e.g., show content in feeds or messages).</li>
    <li>You can delete uploaded content where supported, or request deletion (see Section 10).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use the camera for biometric identification, covert recording, or continuous/background capture.</p>

  <h2 id="info-we-collect">3) Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account &amp; Profile:</strong> name, email/phone, username, role(s), profile details you provide.</li>
    <li><strong>Content You Create:</strong> photos/videos, posts, comments, messages, and related metadata.</li>
    <li><strong>Device &amp; App Data:</strong> device model, OS version, app version, language, diagnostics.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> feature interactions, in-app events (e.g., likes), presence/online status, session timestamps.</li>
    <li><strong>Network Data:</strong> IP address, coarse location inferred from IP (not precise GPS unless explicitly granted elsewhere).</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications Data:</strong> push tokens (e.g., FCM) and delivery outcomes.</li>
    <li><strong>Log Data:</strong> server logs for security/troubleshooting.</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication Data:</strong> access/refresh tokens and identifiers to keep you signed in securely.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="how-we-use">4) How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the app (accounts, feeds, chat, orders/updates, discovery).</li>
    <li>Enable messaging and real-time features (presence, typing indicators, read receipts).</li>
    <li>Send notifications you enable (activity updates, messages, promotions if opted-in).</li>
    <li>Prevent fraud, secure accounts, and enforce policies.</li>
    <li>Analyze performance and reliability (crash reports, diagnostics).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="push">5) Push Notifications</h2>
  <p>We use device tokens (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging) to deliver notifications you allow. Tokens are stored with your account and can be revoked by logging out, disabling notifications in-app/OS, or requesting deletion.</p>

  <h2 id="realtime">6) Real-Time Features</h2>
  <p>We use secure web sockets and similar tech for events like presence updates, typing indicators, and instant message delivery. These transmit only what’s needed (e.g., user ID, event type, timestamps).</p>

  <h2 id="sharing">7) Sharing &amp; Disclosure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> hosting, databases, push delivery (e.g., FCM), logging/monitoring, analytics, support tools.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal &amp; Safety:</strong> to comply with legal requests or protect rights, safety, or security.</li>
    <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, data may transfer as part of the transaction.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>

  <h2 id="retention">8) Data Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Account/profile data: kept while your account is active.</li>
    <li>User content: kept until you delete it or your account, subject to backups/legal obligations.</li>
    <li>Push tokens: kept while notifications are enabled or until invalid/removed.</li>
    <li>Logs/diagnostics: retained only as long as necessary for security and troubleshooting.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="security">9) Security</h2>
  <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the data (e.g., encrypted transport, access controls). No system is perfectly secure; please use a strong password and keep your device updated.</p>

  <h2 id="choices">10) Your Choices &amp; Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access/Update:</strong> edit your profile and settings in-app.</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> manage in-app preferences and OS-level permissions.</li>
    <li><strong>Camera &amp; Media:</strong> you control capture/upload; delete your content where supported.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> request deletion of your account/data at <a href="mailto:michael@quisn.com">michael@quisn.com</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Regional Rights:</strong> where applicable (e.g., GDPR/CCPA), you may access, correct, delete, port, or restrict processing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="children">11) Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Quisn is not directed to children under the age where parental consent is required by local law. If you believe a child provided personal data, contact us.</p>

  <h2 id="transfers">12) International Transfers</h2>
  <p>We may process and store information in countries different from where you reside, with appropriate safeguards.</p>

  <h2 id="changes">13) Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Policy. We’ll change the “Last updated” date and, when required, notify you in-app or by other means. Continued use means you accept the update.</p>
